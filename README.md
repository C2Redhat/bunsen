# I. Bunsen
`bunsen` is a collection of `ansible` entities that will provision a 
user-provided set of systems (physical and/or virtual) as a simulacrum of the
official `VDO` development environment.  In this way you are able to take
advantage of the tools, tests, etc. in the same way as the mainstream
development team.

The basic environment established by `bunsen` consists of:
* One "infrastructure" system (server for other systems)
* One or more "builder" systems (development systems)
* One or more "farm" systems (testing targets)

# II. Getting `bunsen`
As you're reading this README you may already have `bunsen`.  Or, perhaps, 
someone has provided you with this README in which case `bunsen` can be 
acquired from [the Bunsen GitHub repository](https://github.com/dm-vdo/bunsen).

# III. Getting Started

Visit the [Getting Started](Getting_Started.md) document for basic getting started instructions.

# IV. Running Tests in a Bunsen environment

Visit the [BuildingAndTestingBunsen](BuildingAndTestingInBunsen.md) document for basic development and testing instructions.

# V. Future Plans

This document along with the [Getting Started](Getting_Started.md) and [BuildingAndTestingInBunsen](BuildingAndTestingInBunsen.md) are intended to provide a bare-bones level of detail.  A more detailed set of documents is in the works and will be available in the future.
